Hey there, welcome to my site!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, currently focused on Computer Vision and GenAI.

With over 6 years in the industry, I've worn different hats in AI projects, and you can check out my [Portfolio](https://xmarva.github.io/projects/) to see how I might be able to help with your next project.

From time to time, I write about programming, AI, and whatever else comes to mind‚Äîfind all that in my [Blog](https://xmarva.github.io/blog/).

Want a quick snapshot of my experience? Visit my [CV](https://xmarva.github.io/cv/) page, where you can also grab a PDF version.

Beyond AI, I‚Äôm into nature and hiking, learning new languages, and exploring psychoanalysis.
