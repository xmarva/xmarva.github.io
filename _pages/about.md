Hey there, welcome to my website!

I'm an **AI Engineer & Researcher** working with both classical and generative AI in **NLP** and **CV**.

Currently, I’m studying **Cognitive Science** and am deeply interested in philosophy (science, language, and consciousness), psychology, and neurobiology.

I can train models to generalize your data and generate new ones to solve practical engineering tasks. But what kind of AI engineer doesn’t dream of solving the mystery of consciousness and contributing to the creation of strong AI?

I love creating ✨*beautiful*✨ solutions — clean code, creative ideas, efficient models, and solid results.

It would be very bold to claim I always succeed. Sometimes it’s a bit messy (who hasn’t been there?), but I’m always chasing that ideal.

In my free time, I enjoy being in nature, hiking, or finding balance through meditation. A good work-life balance is key to productive thinking. Also, salmon nigiri might just be the peak of human existence 🍣.
