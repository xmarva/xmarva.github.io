Hey there, welcome to my website!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer, currently focused on **Computer Vision** and **GenAI**.

With over 6 years in the industry, I've worn different hats in AI projects, and you can check out my [Portfolio](https://xmarva.github.io/portfolio/) to see how I might be able to help with your next project.

From time to time, I write about AI and whatever else comes to mind‚Äîfind all that in my [Blog](https://xmarva.github.io/blog/).

I‚Äôm also into hiking and traveling, learning new languages, and exploring psychoanalysis.
