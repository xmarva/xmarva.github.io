Hey there, welcome to my website!

I'm an 👩‍💻**AI Engineer & Researcher** working with **Language Processing** and **Computer Vision**.

I’m studying **Cognitive Science** and am deeply interested in:\
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🤔 Philosophy of Mind \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👩‍🔬 Neurobiology \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🧠 Bayesian Brain

I can train models to generalize your data and generate new ones to solve practical tasks. But what kind of AI engineer doesn’t dream of solving the mystery of consciousness and contributing to the creation of strong AI?

What I love is creating ✨*beautiful*✨ solutions — clean code, creative ideas, efficient models, and solid results.

It would be very bold to claim I always succeed. Sometimes it’s a bit messy (who hasn’t been there?), but I’m always chasing that ideal.

In my free time, I enjoy being in nature, hiking, running, cooking food, listening to music. My favorite bands are King Crimson, Clutch and Swans. I believe that good work-life balance and happiness is key to productive thinking.

Also, salmon nigiri might just be the peak of human existence 🍣.
