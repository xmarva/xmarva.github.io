Hey there, welcome to my website!

I'm an 👩‍💻**ML Engineer & Researcher** working with \ 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 💬 Natural Language Processing \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👀 Computer Vision \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 🚀 Generative Models

I’m also interested in **Cognitive Science** and **Philosophy of Mind**.

What I love is creating ✨*beautiful*✨ solutions — clean code, creative ideas, efficient models, and solid results.

It would be very bold to claim I always succeed. Sometimes it’s a bit messy (who hasn’t been there?), but I’m always chasing that ideal.

So, can develop and train models to generalize your data and generate new ones to solve practical tasks. But who in AI doesn't secretly hope to solve the problem of consciousness and play a part in creating strong AI?

Outside of work I enjoy nature, hiking, staying active, cooking, learning languages, and exploring mindfulness through therapy. Good work-life balance and happiness is key to productive thinking.

Also, salmon nigiri might just be the peak of human existence 🍣.
