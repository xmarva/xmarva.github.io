Hey there, welcome to my website!

I’m a **Machine Learning Engineer**, currently focused on **Computer Vision** and **GenAI**.

In a nutshell, I’m passionate about creating ✨*beautiful*✨ Deep Learning. Beauty is a complex function of variables like clean, readable code, creative solutions, efficient resource use, and great results.

It would be a very bold to claim I always make Deep Learning beautiful. Truth be told, sometimes it’s downright messy (who’s perfect, anyway?). But I’m enchanted by the idea of beauty and always strive to achieve it.

Beyond tech, I love nature and hiking, enjoy learning foreign languages, and find balance in life through psychoanalysis and Zen meditation. Also, I firmly believe there’s nothing in the world more important than salmon nigiri 🍣
