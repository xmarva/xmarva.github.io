  abstract={Automation in the analysis of biological data can enhance the accuracy of results and reduce processing time. Analyzing microscopic images is a common task in biology. To demonstrate the proposed method, we analyzed collagen structures in dermal tissue images. A methodology for automatic analysis of microscope images is presented. The object of analysis can be identified using a color vector. The image is then binarized and meshed. For each mesh element, the distribution of mean intercept length (MIL) is calculated. The orientation of objects is estimated using MIL approximation. An equation is proposed to assess the quality of collagen recovery. This method was applied to three sample groups: no ficin (N), ficin-treated (F), and immobilized ficin (Fi). We analyzed 10 images per group and obtained results using the described technique. Collagen recovery quality was: N group – 48% ± 8%, F group – 78% ± 7%, and Fi group – 68% ± 9%. These results suggest that ficin positively influences dermal healing. The obtained data are consistent with previously published studies.},

  title={Construction of an Inhomogeneous Finite Element Model Using Computed Tomography Data},
  author={Sachenkov, O and Gerasimov, O and Koroleva, E and others},
  journal={Russian Journal of Biomechanics},
  abstract={This study presents a methodology for constructing a finite element model (FEM) based on computed tomography (CT) data. The approach was applied to model the femur, emphasizing the importance of capturing the spatial distribution of mechanical properties in bone tissue and the need for individualized modeling. Finite element simulations were performed using ANSYS, and CT data were processed in Avizo. The analysis considered a linear inhomogeneous elastic material. Power-law relationships between optical density and mechanical properties—specifically Young’s modulus and ultimate stress—were employed. Optical density was derived from linear correlations with Hounsfield units. Mechanical properties were assigned to each finite element based on CT data. After solving the stress-strain problem, a safety factor was calculated for each node, taking into account the local material properties. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous models were developed and analyzed. The results clearly demonstrate significant differences in stress-strain responses between the two models. The inhomogeneous model enables evaluation of local bone strength, accounting for patient-specific characteristics.},
