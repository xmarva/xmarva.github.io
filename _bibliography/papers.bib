  abstract={Automation of analyzing the biological data can increase the quality of analyses and decrease spending time. Analyze of the microscope’s bitmaps is usual task in biology. To illustrate the proposed method we used analyzing collagen in dermis snapshots. Methodic to automatic analyses of microscope snapshots is presented. Object of analysis can be determine by color vector. Then the snapshot can be binarized and meshed. For every element we can restore distribution of the mean intercept length. Orientation of the objects can be calculated using approximation of the mean intercept length. Equation to estimate the quality of collagen recovery was presented. We used the method on samples of three types: no ficin group (N), ficin group (F), immobilized ficin (Fi). We tested 10 bitmaps for every group and we got results for all bitmaps according described technique. Quality of collagen recovery values was: for N group – 48% ± 8%, for F group 78 ± 7%, for Fi group 68 ± 9%. It can be concluded that ficin positively influence on dermas recovery. Received results are consistent with published results},

  title={Building the inhomogeneous finite element model by the data of computed tomography},

  journal={Russian Journal of Biomechanics},
  abstract={The aim of the work is to reveal a methodology for constructing a finite element model by tomography data. To evaluate the model, calculations of the femur were carried out. The relevance of this study is confirmed by the effect of the distribution of the mechanical properties of the bone on stress-strain state and the need for individualizing the approach to modeling. Numerical studies were performed using the finite element method in the Ansys software, computer tomography data processing was carried out in the Avizo software. The problem of a linear inhomogeneous elastic body was considered. Power functions of the optical density were used to determine the Young's modulus and the limiting voltage, in turn, the optical density was determined from linear relations depending on the Hounsfield numbers. For finite element model, the mechanical properties of the material were distributed for each element according to the tomography data. After solving the problem of the stress-strain state, at each node a factor of safety was determined adjusted for the properties of the material from the tomography data. Inhomogeneous and homogeneous models with average properties were built. Calculations for both models were performed. Numerical results clearly illustrate significant differences in the results of the stress-strain state of the inhomogeneous and homogeneous models of the organ. Inhomogeneous model allows us to evaluate the local strength of bone tissue taking into account individual characteristics.},
